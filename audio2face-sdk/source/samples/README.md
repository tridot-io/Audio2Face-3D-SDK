# Audio2Face SDK Samples

This directory contains sample applications demonstrating different aspects of the Audio2Face SDK. Each sample is designed to showcase specific features and usage patterns, from basic executor API usage to advanced low-level integration.

## Sample Overview

1. **`sample-a2f-executor`** - Simplest sample with executor API. Shows geometry executor creation with bundles, audio loading, and neutral emotion setup (no A2E needed). Supports both regression and diffusion models. Recommended starting point.

2. **`sample-a2f-a2e-executor`** - Audio2Face and Audio2Emotion integration with streaming capabilities. Shows combined processing, offline vs streaming modes.

3. **`sample-a2f-low-level-api-fullface`** - Advanced usage of low-level API for maximum control. Direct usage of core components with tensor manipulation, NPY data loading, and manual inference engine setup.
